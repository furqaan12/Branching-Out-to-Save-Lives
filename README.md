Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A Machine Learning Approach with Cross-Validation and Decision Trees/Randome Forests.
This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI machine learning repository to classify 568 breast cancer cases into two categories: malignant (M) and benign (B). The dataset contains 30 features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
We used the decision tree and random forest classifiers to classify the cases and evaluated the performance using 5-fold cross-validation. The project provides a confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, F1-score, ROC curve, and area under curve to compare the performance of the two classifiers and determine the best approach for classifying breast cancer.


This project is a great example of using machine learning to analyze complex medical data and has the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient methods for diagnosing breast cancer.
